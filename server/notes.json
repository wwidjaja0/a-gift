    "note": "Hai Katieeeee ! \n\nI'm so grateful to have met you this year. I sort of knew what I was risking by reaching out to you initially, but I didn't think that getting to know you better would be so fun. Although it might be hard to say anything committal at this stage since our story has just begun, but I hope that someday we'll be able to call each other a second home. Here's to more memories in college, ACM, and in our lives beyond. I'll support you even if we have to be apart for a little while, but to be honest, I think I might just want to go where you go, but we will see. :)\n\nThis might be a bit unconventional, and it isn't exactly the most \"letter\" letter, but I hope you enjoy it. Merry Christmas Katie !\n\n- Widjaja :3",
